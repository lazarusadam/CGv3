This a redone version of my SeniorSeminar repository.
This version incorporates a more well-defined character class and racial component to character generation.
Uses Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder as primary gaming sources.  All information about racial and class 
characteristics can be found in the Dungeons and Dragons 5e Player's Handbook and Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core
Rulebook.  Also uses current version of the standard character sheets.
